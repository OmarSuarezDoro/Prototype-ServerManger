# Prototype of a ServerManager in C++
### 1. Description
This project is a very simple server which tries to manage a conection. The client part it is not defined and the threads to manage the connection are going to be changed for a thread manager in a future. It is important to mention that this server doesn't use any kind of verification so, don't try to implemented in your projects unless you know what you are doing.

### 2. Display

Despite the fact that this is a terminal program without any graphical user interface, a lot of message logs will be printed, for now there is no way to select a silent mode, but it will be implemented.

### 3. THANKS
